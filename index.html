                    <h3>Personal</h3>
                    <p>I am a young and motivated individual with a strong passion for sports and technology. As a football player since childhood, I have learned the value of teamwork, discipline, and resilience, qualities that I carry into every aspect of my life. I enjoy spending time with family and friends, meeting new people, and building strong connections. From an early age, I have also been a video game enthusiast, which sparked my curiosity and love for technology. I consider myself a communicative, hardworking, and adaptable person who thrives in collaborative environments and is always eager to learn and grow.</p>

                    <h3>Education</h3>
                    <p>I started my journey in English at the British Isles, completing a comprehensive course from 2014 to 2019 and achieving a B2 level. I then pursued my secondary education at EB 2/3 D. Martinho Vaz in Castelo Branco, following the Science and Technology course, where I graduated with an average of 15,2. Currently, I am in the final year of my Bachelor's degree in Computer and Informatics Engineering at ISEL, developing my skills in software development, programming, and systems engineering, preparing to contribute effectively in the tech industry.</p>
